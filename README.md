NB I like the way this person has stated their problem:

Describe the bug
When making a request to my API, the catch block has a generic "Network Error" message, but when checking in the network inspector the request got a response code 413. This causes my users to incorrectly report that 'the website thinks i dont have a solid internet connection'. I suspect this happens for other codes too because this has been going on for a while.

To Reproduce
Make a request with a very large payload to trigger a 413 response

Expected behavior
The catch block should have the response code

Environment
Axios Version: 0.25.0 and 0.21.2
Adapter: xhr (i think? i dont remember changing this, so i guess whatever is default?)
Browser: Chrome
Browser Version: 97.0.4692.99
Node.js Version: 14.18.1
OS: OSX 12.1
Additional context/Screenshots
axiosInstance
    .post("/results/add", {
      result: completedEvent, //this is very big
    })
    .then((response) => {
      // handle response
    })
    .catch((e) => {
        console.log(e);
        //this console logs Error: Network Error
        // at createError (monkeytype.js:formatted:35086:25)
        // at XMLHttpRequest.handleError (monkeytype.js:formatted:34457:28)
    });

**ðŸ›¸** Working on the visual upstyling today, using the client brand tool![Uploading snip.PNGâ€¦]()
